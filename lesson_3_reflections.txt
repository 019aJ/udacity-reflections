local?

    When you want to share it with other developers or if want to have some backup copy

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	fork makes copy of remote repository on github, copy has link to original

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
